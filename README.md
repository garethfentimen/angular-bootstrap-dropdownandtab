# angular-bootstrap-dropdownandtab

Angular bootstrap

This package includes only the directives and services for dropdown, tab and collapse.

I am creating this project so I can use just dropdowns and tabs through JSPM without ending up with a stupidly big file to include.

`jspm install npm:angular-bootstrap-dropdownandtab`
